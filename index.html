      <h1>Faithful</h1>
        <p>
          God has always been number one in my life... I am guided by my faith and influenced by aspirations greater than my own. Growing up I had a drug problem... my mom <i>drug</i> me to church every Sunday. Little did I know it would eventually lead to the best relationship I have ever had... a relationship with my Savior.

      <h1>A Mountaineer</h1>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in <i>Almost Heaven</i>, West Virginia. Growing up two hours from Morgantown I loved West Virginia University and always had aspirations to be a Mountaineer. I was very fortunate to be given an opportunity to play football for WVU. In 4 years I went from walk-on to team captain and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Sport Management.

      <h1>A Greater Fellow</h1>
        <p>
          I had a great 24-year run in West Virginia, but it was time for me to look for new growth opportunities. I joined the Greater team and moved to my new home in Seattle, Washington on July 17<sup>th</sup>, 2016. As a Greater Fellow I will learn to code while also engaging in personal and proffesional development through Greater's outreach in the Seattle community.
